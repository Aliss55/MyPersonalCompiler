# My personal Compiler
This repo contains the code for a command-line program that performs semantic, lexical, and syntactical analysis of an input code. In the folder *Compilador*, there is a script named Compilar.cmd that should be executed and the program input stated in programa.txt will be analyzed. The rules of the analyzed language are shown in the *DocumentacionGramaticas* folder
